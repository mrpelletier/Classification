## Classification

<i>In this project I analyze a dataset containing 8,000 records belonging to an auto insurance company. Each record is is a customer, the customers information and whether they had filed an insurance claim or not. Here, I cleaned and structured the data and built a classification model that predicted whether the customer would file a claim (1) or not file a claim (0).</i>
